## üíª Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
*   **Backend:** Java, Java Servlets
*   **Database:** MySQL
*   **Server:** Apache Tomcat (or any other Servlet container)
*   **Build Tool (Assumed):** Maven or Gradle

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   JDK (Java Development Kit) 11 or higher.
    *   Apache Maven (or Gradle).
    *   MySQL Server.
    *   Apache Tomcat (or other Servlet container).
2.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Create a MySQL database (e.g., `musicart`).
    *   Import the provided SQL schema (`musicart.sql` - *you would need to create this*) to set up the necessary tables.
    *   Configure database connection details (URL, username, password) in the appropriate Java configuration file (e.g., a `connectDB.java` or properties file).
3.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/TranHuuDat2004/Music_WebJava.git]
    cd music-project
    ```
4.  **Build the Project:**
    *   If using Maven:
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        ```
    *   This will produce a `.war` file in the `target/` directory.
5.  **Deploy:**
    *   Deploy the generated `.war` file to your Apache Tomcat server (e.g., by copying it to the `webapps` directory).
6.  **Access the Application:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/[your-app-context-name]` or `http://localhost:8080/[music-project]` (the context name is usually the name of the `.war` file without the extension).

## üí° Usage

*   **Users:** Navigate through the site using the main menu. Search for music, play songs, view artist details, and engage with community features.
*   **Admin:** Log in with administrator credentials to access the admin dashboard and manage site content and users.
